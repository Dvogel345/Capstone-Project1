Making a browser game

                    Game Requirements

This game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or 1 player (PvE)

The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI

For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players

This game should be winnable or it should keep score (whichever makes more sense)

When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a 
way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts

If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should live in separate files

Effort must be spent on styling and appearance

The HTML code should use sematic tags

The game should have a Readme.md file in the Github repository that describes the inspiration for the 
game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality

                    Bonus Ideas

Make persistent scores in your browser's localStorage

Add interesting music or sound effects to your game
